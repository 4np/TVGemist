A Swift 4 Framework for checking for new releases of open source tvOS / iOS / macOS applications, released using GitHub.

## Installation

### Cocoapods

Using cocoapods is the most common way of installing frameworks. Add something similar to the following lines to your `Podfile`. You may need to adjust based on your platform, version/branch etc.

```
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :tvos, '11.0'
use_frameworks!

pod 'NPOKit', :git => 'https://github.com/4np/GHKit.git'
```

### Swift Package Manager

Add the following entry to your package's dependencies:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/4np/GHKit.git", from: "0.0.2")
```

## Setup

`GHKit` was built to work automatically after the initial configuration by running whenever a view controller _did_ load.

All you need to do is configure `GHKit` in your `AppDelegate`'s `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`. The one method you need to configure is 

```
public func configure(withUser: String, repository: String, shouldIncludePreReleases: Bool, applicationBundle: Bundle, interval: TimeInterval? = nil)
```

| argument                 | description                                            | default value |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| withUser                 | GitHub username                                        | n/a           |
| repository               | GitHub Repository name (for this user)                 | n/a           |
| shouldIncludePreReleases | Whether or not to check for pre-releases               | false         |
| applicationBundle        | Your app's bundle (e.g. `Bundle.main`)                 | n/a           |
| interval                 | How often a check for new releases should be performed | daily         |

Version checking and reporting will happen automatically whenever the interval has passed and the user will be prompted to download the latest release.

### Example

```
//
//  AppDelegate.swift
//  TVGemist
//

import UIKit
import GHKit

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
	func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        // check for new releases every 6 hours
        GHKit.shared.configure(withUser: "4np", repository: "TVGemist", shouldIncludePreReleases: false, applicationBundle: Bundle.main, interval: TimeInterval(exactly: 60 * 60 * 6))
        return true
    }

	...
}
```

### Debugging

In order you test, you could change the interval to 10 seconds (`TimeInterval(exactly: 10)`)

## How does it work?

`GHKit` will [Swizzle](http://nshipster.com/method-swizzling/) `UIViewController`'s `viewDidLoad` method to check for new releases _if_ the interval has passed. It uses the application bundle's version to check against the available GitHub releases and notify the end user if a new version is available. _Note that `GHKit` only reports that a new release is available; it does not download or install anything!_
